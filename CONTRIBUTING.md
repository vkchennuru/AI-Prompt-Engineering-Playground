## Code Style Guidelines

- Keep HTML, CSS, and JS self-contained per file where possible
- Shared styles go in `shared.css`, shared logic in `shared.js`
- Use the existing color variables (e.g., `var(--l1)` through `var(--l6)`)
- All interactive exercises should work without an internet connection
- Keep the tone beginner-friendly and encouraging
